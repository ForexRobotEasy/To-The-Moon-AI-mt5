## Description

The To The Moon AI mt5 Expert Advisor is designed to detect real-time market trends and execute buy or sell trades based on the detected trends. It also includes a profit target feature to exit trades when the target is reached. The Expert Advisor can operate in two work modes: Manual and Auto.

## Global Variables

- `profitTarget`: A double variable that represents the profit target for each trade.
- `isHighImpactNews`: A boolean flag to indicate the presence of high impact news during the US session.
- `WorkMode`: An enum variable to define the work mode settings. It has two options: MANUAL and AUTO.

## Expert Advisor Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the Expert Advisor. It sets the initial work mode based on the `mode` variable. If the work mode is MANUAL, the necessary initialization for manual mode is performed. If the work mode is AUTO, the necessary initialization for auto mode is performed.

## Expert Advisor Start Function

The `OnTick()` function is the main function of the Expert Advisor. It checks if high impact news is detected during the US session. If high impact news is detected, it calls the `DetectMarketTrend()` function to analyze real-time data and identify market trends. If a trend is detected, it executes buy or sell trades based on the detected trends using the `ExecuteTrades()` function. If no high impact news is detected, a message is printed indicating the absence of high impact news during the US session. Additionally, the function checks if the profit target is reached using the `IsProfitTargetReached()` function. If the profit target is reached, a message is printed, and the Expert Advisor is removed.

## Function to Detect Market Trends

The `DetectMarketTrend()` function is responsible for analyzing real-time data and detecting market trends. The logic to analyze the data and detect trends should be implemented in this function. It should return true if a trend is detected and false otherwise.

## Function to Execute Buy or Sell Trades

The `ExecuteTrades()` function is responsible for executing buy or sell trades based on the detected market trends. The logic to execute trades based on the detected trends should be implemented in this function.

## Function to Check if Profit Target is Reached

The `IsProfitTargetReached()` function checks if the profit target is reached. The logic to check if the profit target is reached should be implemented in this function. It should return true if the profit target is reached and false otherwise.

## Expert Advisor Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the Expert Advisor is being deinitialized. It prints a message indicating the deinitialization process.
